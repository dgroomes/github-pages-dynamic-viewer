# Wish List

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* Replace all dependencies with vanilla JavaScript: React, Marked.js, babel. This project is designed to offer a
  "zero-dependencies" tool.
* DONE Load all documents
* DONE draw all documents to the screen (instead of replacing the previous content with the next doc's content)
* Fix up the hash management stuff. This is a bit open-ended. How to make hashes work? I want to be able to click the
  name of a doc from the lefthand nav and have the browser navigate to that fragment. This is just a browser feature. No
  javascript involved.
* The directory listing does not descend into directories? It just loads documents that are in the top-level?
* Support Chrome
* Support Safari
* Support Edge
