This project demonstrates using React, JSX and Markdown with no build tooling. React, Babel and Marked.js are loaded as
script tags. Babel transpiles the ESNext source code on-the-fly in the browser. Likewise, Marked.js compiles the source
Markdown files into HTML on-the-fly in the browser.

This project was originally scaffolded using the example project <https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html>. 

### Instructions

* Run a server with `python3 serve.py`
  * If you are on macOS then Python 3 and its built-in modules are already installed on your computer! If you are not on
    macOS, then you may need to install Python. See <https://www.python.org/downloads/>.
* Open the browser! (<http://localhost:8080>)
