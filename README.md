# react-playground

Learning and exploring React <https://reactjs.org/>.

### Instructions

* Run a server
  * Use the pre-installed python on macOS with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
* Open the browser! (<http://localhost:8000>)

### Notes

This is originally based on <https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html>.

I've included Babel in the web page to render in-browser JSX (i.e. no build step).
